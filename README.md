# Pollstrix - A poll based voting application

Pollstrix is a cross-platform voting application which targets the public to collect and analyse their views on different matters and areas. This application is developed to collect up-to date details from public to avoid outdated surveys. As per the research carried during the project, Sri Lanka in general lacks a survey system which will update the results with the changes in politics, culture, religion, and other factors. 

Pollstrix is a proper solution to solve this. The researchers can use the outcome of the surveys in their articles or research papers. Pollstrix let the users post a question with options and a selected date range to run the survey. Users can view and vote the polls within the selected date range. Voting will be denied to the polls that have passed the end date. The results of ended polls will be shown in descriptive charts such as pie charts and bar charts. To improve accessibility the application supports three languages: English, Sinhala, and Tamil and FAQ section. 

`Support iOS, andorid and web`

`Made with Flutter and Firebase Firestore`
